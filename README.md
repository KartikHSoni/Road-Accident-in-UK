Road Accident Data Analysis and Visualization
This project involves the analysis and visualization of road accident data to understand patterns and identify key trends. The dataset includes detailed information about accidents, including factors such as accident severity, location, weather conditions, and vehicle types involved.

Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple variables:

Accident_Index: Unique identifier for each accident.
Accident Date, Month, Year, Day_of_Week: Date and time details of the accident.
Junction Control, Junction Detail: Information about the type and control of the junction where the accident occurred.
Accident_Severity: Categorization of accidents as fatal, serious, or slight.
Latitude and Longitude: Geographic coordinates of the accident location.
Light_Conditions: Visibility conditions at the time of the accident.
Local_Authority_(District): Administrative district where the accident occurred.
Carriageway_Hazards, Road_Surface_Conditions, Road_Type, Speed_limit: Road characteristics and conditions during the accident.
Number_of_Casualties and Number_of_Vehicles: Number of casualties and vehicles involved in the accident.
Police_Force: Police authority responsible for the area.
Urban_or_Rural_Area: Classification of the accident location as urban or rural.
Weather_Conditions: Weather during the accident.
Vehicle_Type: Types of vehicles involved in the accident.


Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the analyzed road accident data:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Quick statistics like total casualties, fatal casualties, serious casualties, and slight casualties.
Visualizations: Includes a monthly trend comparison between current and previous years, distribution of casualties by vehicle type, road surface conditions, accident location, and road type.
Filter Panel: Allows users to filter data based on urban/rural area, accident severity, and accident date.
This visualization tool aims to help stakeholders, such as traffic management authorities and urban planners, make informed decisions to enhance road safety.
